    <h1>Innovative Solutions for a Smarter Colombo</h1>
    <p>
      Colombo faces critical urban challenges, from overwhelming traffic and waste overflow to flood vulnerability and
      inefficient energy use. This page introduces smart, sustainable solutions such as AI-powered traffic lights,
      IoT-enabled waste bins, flood risk monitoring systems, and solar energy optimization tools. Each solution combines
      technology with urban innovation to build a safer, cleaner, and smarter city for all.

          <h2>Traffic Management</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Colombo suffers from severe congestion during peak hours, particularly along main roads like Galle Road and
          Baseline Road. To address this, I propose a <strong>Smart Traffic Management System</strong> powered by AI and
          IoT technologies. This includes adaptive traffic signals with real-time vehicle detection using cameras and
          sensors. These devices continuously monitor traffic density and automatically adjust signal timings to
          minimize delays and avoid unnecessary waiting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, a centralized control system can analyze traffic data across the city and reroute traffic
          dynamically in case of accidents or road closures. Integrating real-time commute planning tools can also help
          users choose the shortest or least congested routes, reducing overall travel time and emissions.

          <h2>Flood Risk Prevention</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Urban flooding is a recurring issue in low-lying areas of Colombo like Wellampitiya, due to poor drainage and
          unpredictable rainfall. To mitigate this, I propose a <strong>Smart Flood Monitoring System</strong> using
          water-level sensors, rain gauges, and geospatial mapping. These sensors are placed in key flood-prone zones to
          track rising water levels and send real-time data to a central dashboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system simulates risk levels and provides early warnings via SMS, city apps, or digital signage, enabling
          faster evacuation and emergency response. Combined with proper drainage planning and predictive analytics,
          this solution enhances disaster preparedness and helps save lives and infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          To help residents understand flood risks better, this platform includes an interactive Flood Simulator. Users
          can select a locality (e.g., Wellampitiya) and adjust rainfall levels to visualize how different areas
          respond, allowing them to grasp the urgency of preventive action.

          Colombo. This helps visualize how rainfall impacts each neighborhood.

          <h2>Smart Waste Management</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Overflowing bins and irregular garbage collection remain a major challenge in Colombo, especially in crowded
          areas like Wellampitiya. To solve this, I propose the use of <strong>IoT-enabled Smart Bins</strong> equipped
          with ultrasonic sensors that detect the fill level of garbage inside the bin in real-time. Once a bin is
          90–95% full, the system automatically sends an alert to the municipal collection center. This reduces delays,
          prevents overflows, and optimizes collection routes based on actual demand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The smart bin system also collects valuable data about waste generation patterns, helping city planners
          improve logistics and reduce fuel usage. This makes garbage collection more efficient, less labor-intensive,
          and environmentally friendlier.

          <h2>Smart Energy Optimization</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          With Colombo’s growing energy demand and rising electricity bills, many households struggle to manage their
          power use. My proposed solution is a <strong>Smart Solar Energy System</strong> integrated with IoT-based
          monitoring tools. These tools allow users to track their real-time electricity usage, monitor solar power
          generation, and store surplus energy efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system provides detailed insights through a user dashboard showing daily consumption, cost savings, and
          environmental impact. By encouraging the use of rooftop solar and helping users reduce energy waste, this
          solution promotes sustainable living while lowering dependency on the grid. An energy usage tracker helps
          users estimate monthly bills and discover the savings potential of switching to solar.
        </p>
        <p>
          To empower citizens in understanding their personal energy footprint, the platform offers an Energy Tracker –
          an interactive Energy Usage Calculator. Users can input details like appliance usage and duration to estimate
          monthly consumption and identify ways to cut down waste and costs. This not only promotes awareness but also
          encourages sustainable lifestyle changes.
